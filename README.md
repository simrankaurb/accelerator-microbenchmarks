# JAX Benchmarks

A comprehensive, extensible framework for profiling and benchmarking JAX
operations on TPUs and other hardware accelerators.

## Overview

The `accelerator_microbenchmarks` package provides a structured way to measure
the performance (latency, throughput, memory bandwidth) of various JAX
primitives and composite operations. It includes built-in benchmarks for:
*   **Compute Operations:** Generalized GEMMs, Matrix Multiplications,
Attention mechanisms.
*   **Collective Communications:** `psum`, `all_gather`, `all_to_all`, `reduce_scatter` (using `shard_map`).
*   **Memory Bandwidth:** HBM bandwidth profiling.

The framework is highly configurable via YAML files, allowing users to define
parameter sweeps, warm-up iterations, and matrix shapes without modifying Python
code.

## How It Works

1.  **Configuration:** A YAML file (e.g., `configs/sample.yaml`) defines global
settings (number of runs, warmup tries) and a list of benchmarks to execute. It
supports parameter "sweeps" to automatically test a range of dimensions or mesh
shapes.
2.  **Registry:** The `main.py` runner parses the YAML and looks up the
requested benchmark names in a central registry.
3.  **Execution:** For each configuration permutation, the framework
instantiates the benchmark, calls its `setup()`, runs `warmup_tries` iterations,
and then executes `num_runs` iterations while capturing precise timing metrics.

## Installation

You can install the package locally via `pip`. It is recommended to do this in a
dedicated virtual environment:

```bash
pip install .
```

For editable mode (useful when developing custom benchmarks):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Running Benchmarks

<!-- BEGIN BORG-INTERNAL -->
### Using XManager (Recommended for TPUs)

A launch script is provided one level up to deploy benchmarks to a TPU slice via
XManager.

```bash
# From third_party/py/accelerator_microbenchmarks/
bash orchestration/launch.sh
```

You can customize `launch.sh` to change the `TOPOLOGY` (e.g., `4x4x4`), the Borg
cell, or the YAML config path.
<!-- END BORG-INTERNAL -->

### Running Locally with Blaze

If you are on a machine with available accelerators or want to test
functionality on CPU, you can run the binary directly via Blaze:

```bash
blaze run //third_party/py/accelerator_microbenchmarks/src/accelerator_microbenchmarks:main -- \
  --config third_party/py/accelerator_microbenchmarks/configs/sample.yaml
```

## Adding a New Benchmark

To add a new benchmark, please refer to the detailed instructions in [DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md).


## Configuration Guide (YAML)

The YAML configuration supports discrete values and sweep definitions.

```yaml
global:
  warmup_tries: 2
  num_runs: 5
  dtype: "bfloat16"

benchmarks:
  # 1. Fixed parameters
  - name: my_custom_op
    size: 2048

  # 2. List sweep
  - name: my_custom_op
    sweep:
      size: [1024, 2048, 4096]

  # 3. Geometric/Range sweep
  - name: hbm_bandwidth
    sweep:
      size: 
        start: 1024
        end: 8192
        multiplier: 2  # Will test 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192
```

## Reviewing Results

By default, the benchmark runner aggregates results and writes them to the
`results/` directory as `detailed.json` and `summary.csv`. You can use
`tools/sync_results.py` to copy these results out of the XManager execution
environment.
